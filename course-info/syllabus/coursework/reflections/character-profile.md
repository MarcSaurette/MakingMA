# 2. Character Profile

For part of this year’s class, I want you to suspend your disbelief and imagine yourself as a new student at _The Academy_ – a venerable school devoted to teaching the whole of knowledge – human or otherwise... You are a new acolyte seeking enlightenment by studying the Medievalist Arts. Once you arrive at the Academy and get oriented, you will develop your academic skills – training in domains of knowledges along with your classmates to solve mysteries, duel with opponents and \(hopefully\) to uncover the shadowy forces of darkness.

Given the current worldwide pandemic and that most \(all?\) of you will be distant from campus, I thought a bit of time spent in a school –even if only in your imagination– might be welcome. I think this has the potential to be enjoyable, but I fear it also could just be cringeworthy. It’s up to you to decide how much you want to get into this fiction, or if we should just abandon it at some point.

“The Academy” is a fictional conceit –a narrative structure– to give direction to your learning and your academic work for the class. In the first week of class, students will receive with an initial rulebook which will explain the thinking that underlies “the game” and will offer some background on the imaginary world you will inhabit. Further information, clues and quests will be distributed as the year goes on, which –as you complete them– should allow you to uncover the mystery we have concocted. These quests have a fun but serious purpose – teaching you how Medieval Studies came to be, how to think about how we study the Middle Ages and who at Carleton can help you in your personal search for the Middle Ages. 

At the beginning of the term you will 1\) write up a character for the game and 2\) begin a scavenger hunt to earn points towards leveling up at the Academy.

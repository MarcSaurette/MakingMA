# Research

### Goals for this week \(October 5/7\)

By the end of the first week \(by Sunday, October 11th\), what should you **know**, be able to **do** and **understand**?

1. You will know the basics about the formation of Medieval Studies as a discipline
2. You will learn about the basics of conducting scholarly research using Library resources
3. You will practice using [hypothes.is ](../course-info/digital-tools/hypothes.is.md)to comment on a website \(wikipedia\)

### Overview:

This week we are getting to the meat and potatoes of the material for this term â€“ starting our descent into the murky origins of Medieval Studies, and getting a sense of why we study the Middle Ages at all today \(and why even in North America we consider it a foundational period for our history\). To get a sense of why people think about the discipline, we will start with a tertiary resource which can be seen to embody general ideas of what Medieval Studies is, Wikipedia. 

This week I want you to: 

1. read and use hypothes.is to comment on the [Medieval Studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_studies) entry on Wikipedia.
2. read and annotate "How to write Fake Global History" on Perusall. 
3. read and annotate the next chapter of _Thinking Medieval_ on Perusall.

### **Online Time**

This week will have two synchronous meetings. On Monday the 5th, we will have our class time as normal and on October 7th, we will have Susan Tudin from MacOdrum Library introduce us to online resources for doing research. 

As usual, I'll be online 30 mins before the start of class on Wednesdays to help with questions you might have, concerns you want to address and the such.

# Evidence

### Goals for this week \(September 28/30, 2020\)

By the end of this week, what should students **know**, be able to **do** and **understand**?

* how to conceptualize the difference of primary and secondary sources
* consider how primary and secondary sources require different ways of reading
* consider how Medieval Studies has developed a range of sub-disciplines to understand how to read primary sources

### Overview:

Provide a short rationale for this week’s work suggesting its purpose in terms of the program of studies. \(Why we're doing this...\)

### **Online Time**

On Monday, September 28th, we will be discussing questions raised by Marcus Bull's chapter on the "Evidence for Medieval History". 

### Read/Watch/Listen

What do students need to read this week?

### Practice

Are there practical activities \(tasks, labs, fieldwork\), which students must do this week? If so, what are they and what specifically do they need to do, bearing in mind social-distancing?

### **Discuss**

What questions should students be discussing with each other on the discussion board for this course?

* students should think about what we expect to be able to say truthfully about sources from the past
* and consider how, even if the sources are clearly lying to you, what kinds of things can we still use it to reveal about the past 

### **Do**

What quizzes \(if any\) or other activities should students complete this week to evaluate their own progress? How will they know they are “on track”?

Submit an [End of Week Report ](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=lRjZagbeXki8UfzhJsyFMHYe4bjIkPJLpePMoYTjyCNUQlY3V0pYOVJPQVMzVDJXR05OWjBHT01YQy4u)on Sunday night \(each week\) to let me know if you have any questions and \(this week\) to provide a link to your cuPortfolio profile.

### **Assess** 

Is there a graded assignment this week? If so, what is the assignment and when does it need to be submitted?

### Going Further

If students want to do more to ensure success, what materials and resources \(e.g. reading, video, audio simulations, games\) do you recommend?

### **Help**

 If a student is struggling, how should they seek help?

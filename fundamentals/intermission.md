# Intermission

Week Six will only have a single class on Wedneday \(fOctober 14th, 2020\) due to Thanksgiving falling on the Monday. 

We intend to use this week to catch up on topics have merit more investigation, explanation or debate, to address any issues that have arisen, and to provide help on assignments. 

But the first 45 minutes of class, will be devoted to exploring the idea of "What is the point of History" drawing on the reading of Marc Block's _The Historian's Craft_ as the focus for our discussion.

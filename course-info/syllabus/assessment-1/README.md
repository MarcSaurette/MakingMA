# Assessment

Most first-year classes in History are full year \(two semester\) courses. We do this so that students who arrive at university have time to settle into class and get accustomed to the expectations of university. The First-Year Seminar program is designed specifically to address this, focusing not only on disciplinary content \(i.e. teaching you facts about the past\) but also teaching skills fundamental for academic success. 

This is why this class is designed to start off slow, getting you to question what you already know about the Middle Ages and teaching you the building blocks of historical analysis/writing. I hope that you are able to experience the class as collaborative, not competitive. You are all starting off together and I want you to see each other as peers, colleagues and potential friends from whom you all can learn. Assignments are thus designed with the expectation that you can work together with others or that you see/read other students' work and learn from it. Your peers can be inspiring. 

This "Making of the Middle Ages" is likewise designed for gradual entry, with the first term designed to have no formal grades assigned for work, but rather there is a mixture of required and optional work that you can use to earn points.You have many different ways of gaining points, and once you reach different levels, you are worthy to win new titles and honours \(see table below\). If you want, you can tell yourself that these correspond to different grade levels. At the end of the term, you also will be responsible for writing up a self-assessment of your participation and work \(see [Process Letter](../coursework/process-letters.md)\), taking your point level also into account. I am using the system in order to avoid a system of grading that has the potential to make you all less collaborative and more competitive. For more on why I am not using traditional grading, see the next page, "[Why are there no grades](why-no-grades.md)".

| Experience Points† | Titles and Honours |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1500 | His/Her/Their Eminence, the Acolyte \[ name here \] |
| 1300 | Venerable Acolyte \[ name here \] |
| 1100 | Right Reverend Acolyte \[ name here \] |
| 900 | Reverend Acolyte \[ name here \] |
| 700 | Honourable Acolyte \[ name here \] |
|  600 | Acolyte \[ name here \], F.O.R. \(Fellow of the Order of the Raven\) |

† I haven't really used this system before so I might need to adjust these numbers downwards if I've set them too high. 

In the second term, together as a class we will decide whether to retain a non-grade system, or whether you corporately wish to return to a more familiar system.

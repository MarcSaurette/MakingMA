# Quests

A key part of learning is discovering what you want to know, so I've designed a series of self-directed "quests". So long as you can demonstrate you have fulfilled the necessary conditions, you can win  for you to keep you deepening your knowledge. I list below a series of skills you might wish to develop as new acolytes to the Historical Arts. You can demonstrate your mastery of a skill that will earn you experience points.

### The Seeking

In the first few weeks of class, students will work in pre-assigned groups on "The Seeking" - an online scavenger hunt meant to orient you to the university, the department and each other. 

### Individual Quests

Below is a table of beginner level skills to develop individually and independetly. More advanced skills can be pursued upon completion of the starting level skills \(to be posted in the future\). After the first weeks of class, the current list will be supplemented by a description of the conditions necessary to be met in order for each student to demonstrate their mastery of a skill.

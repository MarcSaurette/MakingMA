# 2. Character Profile

**Due 10pm, Sunday September 27th**

For part of this year’s class, I want you to suspend your disbelief and imagine yourself as a new student at _The Academy_ – a venerable school devoted to teaching the whole of knowledge – human or otherwise... You are a new acolyte seeking enlightenment by studying the Medievalist Arts. Once you arrive at the Academy and get oriented, you will develop your academic skills – training in domains of knowledges along with your classmates to solve mysteries, duel with opponents and \(hopefully\) to uncover the shadowy forces of darkness.

Given the current worldwide pandemic and that most \(all?\) of you will be distant from campus, I thought a bit of time spent in a school –even if only in your imagination– might be welcome. I think this has the potential to be enjoyable, but I fear it also could just be cringeworthy. It’s up to you to decide how much you want to get into this fiction, or if we should just abandon it at some point.

“The Academy” is a fictional conceit –a narrative structure– to give direction to your learning and your academic work for the class. In the first week of class, students will receive with an initial rulebook which will explain the thinking that underlies “the game” and will offer some background on the imaginary world you will inhabit. Further information, clues and quests will be distributed as the year goes on, which –as you complete them– should allow you to uncover the mystery we have concocted. These quests have a fun but serious purpose – teaching you how Medieval Studies came to be, how to think about how we study the Middle Ages and who at Carleton can help you in your personal search for the Middle Ages. 

At the beginning of the term you will 1\) write up a character for the game and 2\) begin a scavenger hunt to earn points towards leveling up at the Academy. 

Please find below fillable pdf character sheets that you might want to use to present your character to your fellow classmates \(but you don't need to\). Feel free to design your own on paper and post a scan to cuPortfolio, create a cuPortfolio version, or post the filled out template there. You can see mine [here](https://cuportfolio.carleton.ca/view/view.php?t=MpHJTKXdS4jzqZyLO3h7) \(you might need to sign into cuPortfolio first\). 

Also, I've created an overly-detailed guide on how to create a Medievalist character \([posted on Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/file/D880313A-D8D4-4648-AD77-2862440FDC02?tenantId=6ad91895-de06-485e-bc51-fce126cc8530&fileType=pdf&objectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fcmailcarletonca.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FTheMakingoftheMiddleAges%2FShared%20Documents%2FQuest%20for%20the%20Middle%20Ages%2FQuest%20for%20the%20Middle%20Ages%20-%20Basic%20Rules%202.0%20-%20Sept%202020.pdf&baseUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fcmailcarletonca.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FTheMakingoftheMiddleAges&serviceName=teams&threadId=19:9da4334b1e974aba99aeffa79987a865@thread.tacv2&groupId=2000157d-2098-47ef-b47d-341fc17c0e3a)\). In a nod to the fantasy genre, the guide \(some of which you've read in the orientation guide\) describes Medievalists as if engaging in a battle between good and evil \(which perhaps we are...\) and outlines potential skills to learn, knowledge domains to specialize in, weapons to wield etc. If you have an affinity for Role-Playing Games it will look familiar-ish to you. You can also through it out the window if you want and just make up a character from scratch without reading it at all ....

{% hint style="info" %}
The goal of your character is for you to create an identity \(perhaps much like yourself, or perhaps not at all like you\), which will allow you to imagine how someone might begin down the path of exploring the discipline of history/ medieval studies. What makes someone study the Middle Ages? What kind of experiences or background would help you to excel? 
{% endhint %}

Your character profile should include a description of:

* the character's background \(is there something about their background which drives them to study the past? are they good or have an affinity for evil?\)
* describe your character's appearance – what they look like, how they dress \(be as imaginative as you want. Are they human or not?
* their chosen field of study and possible future directions \(i.e. would they want to study architecture? or medieval manuscripts? Or court records?\)
* have a space to list skills to be developed in class in the future. This in essence will be a place where you list skills you have "earned" over the course of the class. 
* have a place for academic reputation \(you all start with 10 - the highest until you demonstrate yourself to be unworthy\)
*

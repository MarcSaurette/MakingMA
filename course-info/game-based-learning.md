# Game-Based Learning

More coming soon at the beginning of term.

Games can be fun, but they can also be serious. But whether playing in earnest or otherwise, games teach you alot. In this class, I hope to make use of games to lighten the mood of \(presumably\) one of your first university classes, but also to encourage real learning. 

In the first semester, part of the class work will be related to a semester-long game 

Why Games?

University is a bit of a game. When you first come here, you need to learn the rules, and then over the course of your undergraduate you pick up tricks and strategies that help you do better and better at it. Like learning to play a boardgame or videogame. One of words of advice from one of my professors that really stuck with me was that all students need to "Fake it until you make it", by which she meant that you need to put up a professional facade or appearance of doing well in order to do well. This is not to say that you need to feel like you should never show weakness, but rather the first stage of learning is trying to **feel** like you are a student and to **believe** that you belong in university. The advice was especially helpful to me when I was in grad school because it made realize something important: that even though I might feel like a fake for not knowing everything, I didn't need to. University is about testing the limits of your knowledge, maybe failing at something, and then playing another round to do better. 

In this class I want to take this a step further. I don't want you to imagine yourself as a Carleton student stuck somewhere you might not want to be \(?\) in the midst of a worldwide pandemic. Rather I want you to imagine yourself as a new initate at a venerable school, "The Academy" in a parallel world where scholars are the last line of defence against encroaching forces of darkness.

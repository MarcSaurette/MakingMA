# What to incorporate as we go forward

1. Domain of one's own \(building Hcommons profile, potential blog...\)
2. Incorporate Global History Podcast...
3. think about an assignment. Create a walking tour of medieval stuff - get them walking and try to find stuff that they think is medieval = part exercise routine, part assignment on Gothic Revival.

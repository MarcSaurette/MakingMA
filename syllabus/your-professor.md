# Your Professor

My purpose \(as the professor\) is to act as your contact person, academic guide and tutor \(as well as a medieval specialist\). I will teach you content \(i.e. facts about the past\), but also I will help you to figure out how to go about being a university student, especially when these days we're experimenting with what "being a university student" means. 

As a professor, you tend to accrue more and more online identities as time goes by. You can check out my [Departmental Profile](https://carleton.ca/history/people/marc-saurette/) or my [Hcommons profile](https://hcommons.org/members/saurette/) if you want to know more about the academic me. I also have a [profile page](https://cuportfolio.carleton.ca/view/view.php?t=R0JhOVq2vQu3xfWjiceY) in Carleton's edossier system \(cuPortfolio\), which we will be using in class this year. 

These kinds of academic/ professional sites obscure something key about your professors. Usually, they got into this whole world because they loved something about the past. For me, it started with die-cast knights and Lego castles. It only got worse after spending several years of my childhood in Germany - surrounded by medieval villages, ruined castles and awe-inspiring cathedrals. I started reading historical fiction 



In short order, I found myself in the Department of History at the University of Manitoba, soaking up _mediævalia_ from ex-missionaries, Byzantinists and the new historicists in the English department. But choice encounters with a charismatic Victorianist and a committed researcher of Latin American history drew me into the worlds of nineteenth-century _égouts_, class identity and cultural power dynamics.

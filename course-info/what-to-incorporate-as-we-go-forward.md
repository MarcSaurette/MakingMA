# What to do as we go forward

1. Domain of one's own \(building Hcommons profile, potential blog...\)
2. Incorporate Global History Podcast...
3. think about an assignment. Create a walking tour of medieval stuff - get them walking and try to find stuff that they think is medieval = part exercise routine, part assignment on Gothic Revival. 

[Best practices for online synchronous Teaching](https://www.chronicle.com/interactives/advice-online-teaching) 

1. Be present

* Post a weekly announcement to provide an overview of the coming week’s topic or a recap of the previous week’s work, or both.
* Respond to questions posted in an online question-and-answer discussion forum or sent to you by email.
* Hold online office hours according to a schedule, by appointment, or both.
* Post a quick video to clarify misconceptions about a class topic or assignment.
* Grade and return students’ work in a timely fashion.
* Talk with students in online discussions.

2. Be yourself

* **Infuse your writing with warmth.** Convey your support. In your weekly announcement, for example, don’t write, _“Some of you have skipped the past few quizzes. You won’t pass this class if you continue to do so.”_ Instead, write, _“Thank you for your work in this class. I know it’s a lot to manage. Just a reminder, make sure you’re taking all the quizzes to help you be successful here. Please contact me if I can help or answer any questions. Thanks!”_ 
* **Be human.** Sometimes the inherent distance between professor and student in an online class infects your written communication. But you needn’t write in a detached tone. Instead, practice immediacy. For example, at the end of a set of assignment instructions, you could write, _“If you have any questions at all about what you are supposed to do on this assignment, please remember I am here to help. Reach out any time so I can support your success.”_ That is more friendly, more caring, and more reassuring than, _“Questions? Post them in the Q&A discussion forum.”_

Here are some examples of how to scaffold activities in an online course. When possible, make these an opportunity for you to give incremental feedback so students know whether or not they are on the right track:

* Let’s say you want students to record a video presentation of their research topics. It’s hard enough to give a good presentation without the video-recording element. So help your online students gain practice with the technology _before_ they have to use it for a high-stakes project. For example, in the first week or two of class, give them a low-stakes, low-stress assignment: Ask them to record and post a two-minute video introducing themselves to the class.
* As part of an orientation module, ask students to send you a message using the LMS messaging/email system so they know how to do this later in the class if they have a question for you. Ask them to answer a question about the syllabus or to list two goals for their learning in the course. Reply with a short personal greeting so they know you received the message and are available to help.
* During Week 1, ask students to upload a PDF file of their handwritten work solving the first step of a problem. This exercise will help them learn how to turn a photo on their mobile device into a PDF file, and how to submit it as an assignment in the LMS. It’s a good way correct any missteps early on.
* At the beginning of the first module, ask students use one of the many free [mind-mapping tools](https://mashable.com/2013/09/25/mind-mapping-tools/#mFOqTnYzx8qD) available on the web to create a concept map of what they already know about the course topic. Then, at the end of each module, assign students to create a summary concept map to help them make sense of each topic.

Look for ways to break down complex tasks so that students make timely progress and receive feedback on their work while there is still time to adjust their approach if needed.

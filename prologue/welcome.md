# Orientation

### Goals for this week \(September 9, 2020\)

By the end of the first week \(by Sunday, September 13th\), what should you **know**, be able to **do** and **understand**?

1. You'll get to know a bit about your professor and your fellow classmates
2. You will know what the course is all about and how we're going to run it
3. You will figure out how to use some tools necessary for learning online

### Overview:

The first week of class provides a transition back to school. This year the transition back to school also corresponds to a transition to online learning. This week asks you to focus on practical concerns, especially on getting used to the online environment we will be using in this class. Normally the first class of the year focusses on handing out/ discussing the syllabus and getting to know one another. So we're doing that this year. This week I want you to: 

1. Read the syllabus and schedule on Gitbook \(i.e. this place\). 
2. Use [MS Teams](../course-info/digital-tools/teams.md) \(activate, install and login to the class group\). 
3. Login to[ Perusall](../course-info/digital-tools/perusall.md) and start annotating your first reading assignment. 
4. Read up about the[ Digital tools ](../course-info/digital-tools/)we'll be using this year.
5. [Introduce yourself and say hello](../course-info/syllabus/coursework/assignments/1.-introduce-yourself.md) to your classmates in the week one channel on Teams.
6. Complete this [background survey]() to let me know more about you. 

### **Online Time**

This week we will not have any dedicated synchronous online time in order to give everyone time to download and install Teams, which we will be using to meet up online for the class. You need ensure that you have Teams installed on your computer and working so that you can join our class in week 2's online time.

During class time in the first week \(11h30-2h30, Tuesday September 15, 2020\), I will be online, checking email and on Teams. I'll be available to help \(as much as I can\) if you have any connection issues or any questions that arise from your reading the syllabus. 

### Read/Watch/Listen

Once you have logged-in to [Perusall](), you will find a pdf copy of the syllabus \(a truncated and simplifed version of this Gitbook course guide\). Please read it, and annotate it to emphasize key ideas, or ask questions of things which don't make sense. 

### Practice

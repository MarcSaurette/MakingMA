# Classwork

### Learning Together

Each week, we officially have 3hrs of assigned class time, divided into two time slots of 1.5 hrs each, on Mondays & Wednesdays from 1:00 to 2:30 pm.

On Mondays, I will introduce the topic for that week, provide some background and then typically \(online\) we will discuss the readings and questions raised by the students in advance. 

On Wednesday, we may continue our discussion or will work through a problem or exercise. Often students will have to do some work to prepare in advance. Examples of what kinds of classroom exercises we might do:

* discuss an online article we have all annotated beforehand with [hypothes.is](../../digital-tools/hypothes.is.md) to understand the structure of an academic article
* work with a collaborative spreadsheet to create a class-built timeline
* compare transcriptions of a Middle English romance

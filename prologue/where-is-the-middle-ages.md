# Where is the Middle Ages?

### Goals for this week \(September 21/23, 2020\)

By the end of this week, what should students **know**, be able to **do** and **understand**?

* understand the fluidity to the geographic component of historical analysis
* learn some approaches for reading scholarly sources via annotation
* begin work on your personal _Quest for the Middle Ages_

### Overview:

This week we will move from examing the Middle Ages as a temporal phenomenon \(a historical period\) to exploring its geographic definition. By understanding how medievalists are redefining the geographic extent of the "Medieval World", we will be able to nuance our idea of the Middle Ages

* we will try to understand why academics write the way they do \(and why it is important for scholars to sometimes be obstuse\)
* we will read about the historiography of the "Global Middle Ages"
* we will seek to understand how the modern concept of the "National State" impacts how we view the past \(including the Middle Ages\)
* we will seek to understand how new research on economic, social, religious and cultural exchange binds together a much wider geographic area than is traditionally considered "Medieval"
* learn about the game-based learning component of the first term of class

### **Online Time**

On Monday, September 21st, the professor will speak about the traditional geographic definition of the "Medieval World" and how this has changed in the last decades. Students will be asked to consider their own inherited ideas about the Middle Ages to see where and why they place borders. 

On Wednesday, September 23rd, the professor will lead students through the process of reading and annotating a scholarly article \(and how to do so quickly\). He will also demonstrate how to use the [hypothes.is](../course-info/digital-tools/hypothes.is.md) social annotation tool and the bibliographic software, [Zotero](../course-info/digital-tools/zotero.md). You might want to have registered and installed this software in time for this class, but this is optional. 

### Read/Watch/Listen

Students will need to read and annotate:

* An article entitled, "Where are the Middle Ages" on a scholarly blog, the Public Medievalist, a copy of which is located on Perusall. 
* Chapter two of Marc Bloch's _The Historian's Craft_ \(continuing\)
* 
### Practice

Cluny foundation - translation exercise

### **Discuss**

What questions should students be discussing with each other on the discussion board for this course?

### **Do**

Students will create a new page on cuPortfolio to present a "character profile" for their avatar in the _Quest for the Middle Ages_. Students may wish to do some further reading about the game to complete your profile. 

### **Assess** 

Is there a graded assignment this week? If so, what is the assignment and when does it need to be submitted?

### Going Further

If students want to do more to ensure success, what materials and resources \(e.g. reading, video, audio simulations, games\) do you recommend?

### **Help**

 If a student is struggling, how should they seek help?

# Assessment

Most first-year classes in History are full year \(two semester\) courses. We do this so that students who arrive at university have time to settle into class and get accustomed to the new expectations of university. 

This class is designed for gradual entry, with the first term designed to have no formal grades assigned for work, but rather there is a mixture of required and optional work that you can use to earn points.

# Game-Based Learning

{% hint style="danger" %}
More coming soon at the beginning of term. 
{% endhint %}

Games can be fun, but they can also be serious. But whether playing in earnest or not, games teach you lots. You learn the rules, how to use the rules to win \(usually\), and you learn to imagine yourself in the world of the game. In this class, I hope to make use of games to lighten the mood of \(presumably\) one of your first university classes, but also to encourage real learning. 

In the first semester, part of the class work will be linked to a semester-long game \(part role-playing game, part augmented reality game\), where we imagine ourselves as schoolmasters and novice students at a venerable "Academy" in a parallel world. In the second semester, we will use that experience to create a new game \(games?\), which are related to medieval themes. 

### Why Games?

University is a bit of a game. When you first come here, you need to learn the rules, and then over the course of your undergraduate you pick up tricks and strategies that help you do better and better at it â€“ ike learning to play a boardgame or videogame. One of words of advice from one of my professors that really stuck with me was that all students need to "Fake it until you make it", by which she meant that you need to put up a professional facade or appearance of doing well in order to do well. This is not to say that you need to feel like you should never show weakness \(wrong!\), but rather the first stage of learning is trying to **feel** like you are a student and to **believe** that you belong in university. The advice was especially helpful to me when I was in grad school because it made realize something important: that even though I might feel like a fake for not knowing everything, I didn't need to. University is about testing the limits of your knowledge, maybe failing at something, and then playing another round to do better. 

In this class I want to take this a step further. I don't want you to imagine yourself as a Carleton student stuck somewhere you might not want to be \(?\) in the midst of a worldwide pandemic. Rather I want you to imagine yourself as a new initate at a venerable school, "The Academy" in a parallel world where scholars are the last line of defence against encroaching forces of darkness.

As the term nears, I will begin posting more information about the game, including a player handbook, and some initial suggestions for your play. 

{% hint style="info" %}
I am designing this game with the idea that different students will have more or less experience with playing medieval-themed games and more or less knowledge of the Middle Ages than others. But, we are designing the class/ this game in such a way that you can contribute in different ways. You can be as ludic \(synonym for "playful"\) as you want, or you can be as traditionally academic as you want. There is no way I want to force you to do something you don't want to.
